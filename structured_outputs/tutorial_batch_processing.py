# # Batch processing with the Batch API
#
# The new Batch API allows to **create async batch jobs for a lower price and with higher rate limits**.
#
# Batches will be completed within 24h, but may be processed sooner depending on global usage. 
#
# Ideal use cases for the Batch API include:
#
# - Tagging, captioning, or enriching content on a marketplace or blog
# - Categorizing and suggesting answers for support tickets
# - Performing sentiment analysis on large datasets of customer feedback
# - Generating summaries or translations for collections of documents or articles
#
# and much more!
#
# This cookbook will walk you through how to use the Batch API with a couple of practical examples.
#
# We will start with an example to categorize movies using `gpt-4o-mini`, and then cover how we can use the vision capabilities of this model to caption images.
#
# Please note that multiple models are available through the Batch API, and that you can use the same parameters in your Batch API calls as with the Chat Completions endpoint.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup

# %%
# Make sure you have the latest version of the SDK available to use the Batch API
# %pip install openai --upgrade

# %%
import json
from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import Image, display

# %%
# Initializing OpenAI client - see https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python
client = OpenAI()

# %% [markdown]
# ## First example: Categorizing movies
#
# In this example, we will use `gpt-4o-mini` to extract movie categories from a description of the movie. We will also extract a 1-sentence summary from this description. 
#
# We will use [JSON mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode) to extract categories as an array of strings and the 1-sentence summary in a structured format. 
#
# For each movie, we want to get a result that looks like this:
#
# ```
# {
#     categories: ['category1', 'category2', 'category3'],
#     summary: '1-sentence summary'
# }
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Loading data
#
# We will use the IMDB top 1000 movies dataset for this example. 

# %%
dataset_path = "data/imdb_top_1000.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(dataset_path)
df.head()

# %% [markdown]
# ### Processing step 
#
# Here, we will prepare our requests by first trying them out with the Chat Completions endpoint.
#
# Once we're happy with the results, we can move on to creating the batch file.

categorize_system_prompt = '''
Your goal is to extract movie categories from movie descriptions, as well as a 1-sentence summary for these movies.
You will be provided with a movie description, and you will output a json object containing the following information:

{
    categories: string[] // Array of categories based on the movie description,
    summary: string // 1-sentence summary of the movie based on the movie description
}

Categories refer to the genre or type of the movie, like "action", "romance", "comedy", etc. Keep category names simple and use only lower case letters.
Movies can have several categories, but try to keep it under 3-4. Only mention the categories that are the most obvious based on the description.

# Each request is defined as such:

# ```

#         "messages": <MESSAGES>,
#         // other parameters
#     }
# }
# ```
#
# Note: the request ID should be unique per batch. This is what you can use to match results to the initial input files, as requests will not be returned in the same order.

# ## Wrapping up
#
# In this cookbook, we have seen two examples of how to use the new Batch API, but keep in mind that the Batch API works the same way as the Chat Completions endpoint, supporting the same parameters and most of the recent models (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo...).
#
# By using this API, you can significantly reduce costs, so we recommend switching every workload that can happen async to a batch job with this new API.
