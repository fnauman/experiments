# OpenAI Vision API Cost Analysis for Garment Classification

## Executive Summary

**Question**: Is it worth using prompt caching and batch API for processing 1,000 images?

**Answer**: **YES**, but with important caveats about scale and implementation costs.

## üî¢ Cost Breakdown (per 1,000 images)

| Approach | Cost | Savings vs Baseline | Notes |
|----------|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Individual API calls** | $5.08 | Baseline | Default approach |
| **Individual + Caching** | $4.93 | $0.15 (3%) | Minimal benefit |
| **Batch API only** | $2.54 | $2.54 (50%) | Major savings |
| **Batch + Caching** | $2.46 | $2.61 (51%) | **Optimal approach** |

### Image Detail Level Impact

| Detail Level | Cost per Image | Use Case |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Low | $0.0010 | Basic classification only |
| Auto | $0.0051 | **Recommended** - balanced quality/cost |
| High | $0.0072 | Fine-grained analysis needed |

## üìä Monthly Projections (1,000 images/day)

- **Optimized daily cost**: $2.46
- **Monthly cost**: $73.88  
- **Yearly cost**: $899.06

## üéØ Recommendations

### ‚úÖ **For 1,000+ images/day: IMPLEMENT optimizations**

**Savings**: 51% reduction in costs  
**Monthly savings**: ~$78 vs individual calls  
**Implementation priority**:
1. Batch API (saves ~50%)
2. Prompt caching (additional 1.5% savings)
3. Image preprocessing (resize to 512x512)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**

**Break-even Analysis**:
- Development effort: ~2-3 days ($2,000)
- Break-even point: ~765,550 images
- **At 1,000 images/day**: Break-even in **2.1 years**

**Conclusion**: The optimization is worth it for **operational cost savings** but has a **long payback period** for the initial development investment.

## üí° Alternative Approaches

### For Immediate Cost Reduction (No Development)
1. **Use "low" detail** for basic classification: 91% cost reduction
2. **Reduce image size** to minimum required resolution
3. **Optimize prompts** to reduce token count

### For Long-term Scale
- Batch API + Caching becomes more valuable at higher volumes
- Consider hybrid approach: low detail for filtering, auto/high detail for final analysis

## üîß Implementation Guide

### Batch API Setup
```python
# Submit batch job
batch_response = client.batches.create(
    input_file_id="your_input_file_id",
    endpoint="/v1/chat/completions",
    completion_window="24h"
)
```

### Prompt Caching Strategy
```python
# Cache the system prompt (120 tokens)
system_prompt = """You are an expert fashion analyst..."""

# This gets cached across requests, saving ~$0.00015 per call
```

### Image Preprocessing
```python
# Resize to 512x512 to minimize token usage
img_resized = img.resize((512, 512), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
```

## üìà Scale Analysis

| Daily Volume | Monthly Cost (Optimized) | Annual Savings vs Individual |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 100 images | $7.39 | $936 |
| 1,000 images | $73.88 | $9,360 |
| 10,000 images | $738.75 | $93,600 |

## üéØ Final Recommendation

**For 1,000 images/day processing**:

‚úÖ **DO implement** Batch API + Prompt Caching if:
- You process images regularly (daily/weekly)
- Operational cost reduction is prioritized
- You have development resources available
- Processing can tolerate 24-hour batch delays

‚ö†Ô∏è **CONSIDER alternatives** if:
- You need real-time processing
- Development resources are limited
- Volume is inconsistent or temporary
- Budget is extremely tight

### Quick Win Strategy
1. **Start with "low" detail** for 91% immediate cost reduction
2. **Implement batch processing** when development resources allow
3. **Add prompt caching** for marginal additional savings
4. **Monitor actual token usage** vs estimates
